Students who earn less than a B at semester 1 may be moved from the accelerated class to Geometry. Students who earn less than a B at semester 2 will not remain in the accelerated class the following year. This is the first year of a two year program encompassing all standards from Common Core Geometry, Common Core Algebra 2/Trigonometry, and PreCalculus. This course will cover 7 critical focus areas: 1) congruence, 2) similarity, right triangles, and trigonometry, 3) circles, 4) expressing geometric properties with equations, 5) geometric measurement and dimension, 6) modeling, and 7) statistics and probability. (Highest math course offered for freshmen. May be able to take Multivariable Calculus/Linear Algebra by 12th grade with this class.)',
